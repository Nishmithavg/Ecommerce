      <h2>The first Shopify store was our own</h2>
      <h5>Over a decade ago, we started a store to sell snowboards online. None of the ecommerce solutions at the time gave us the control we needed to be successful—so we built our own. Today, businesses of all sizes use Shopify, whether they’re selling online, in retail stores, or on-the-go.</h5>
